Welcome to the [DevWars](https://DevWars.tv) TV codebase. This is the core UI and interface for the the DevWars platform.

## What is DevWars?

[DevWars.tv](https://www.devwars.tv/) is a live game show for developers that is currently streamed on [Twitch](https://www.twitch.tv/devwars). People of all levels participate in an exhilarating battle to create the best website they can within 60 minutes. Teams are formed of 3 people, with the team's members each controlling a single language - HTML, CSS and JavaScript.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

-   [Nodejs](https://nodejs.org/en/): 10.0 or higher
-   [DevWars API](https://github.com/devwars/devwars-api/): Lastest version.

### Dependency Installation

Run `npm install` to install dependent node_modules.

### Environment Variables

Make a copy of the `.env.example` file in the same directory and rename the given file to `.env`. This will be loaded up into the application when it first starts running. These are required configuration settings to ensure correct function. Process through the newly created file and make the required changes if needed.

### Development

Running `npm run dev` will start a development server that will automatically restart when changes occur. Additionally running `npm run build` or `npm run start` will allow running a production ready version of the platform.
